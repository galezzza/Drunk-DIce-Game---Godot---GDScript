# Godot "Drunk Dice" Game written using GDScript  

## Game description!

This project is an proto- version of game that was built by myself on GDScript. Idea of this project is very simple:

- In the center of the screen is a field with a set size (usually 6x6).
- Each cell of this field is a task that the player has to perform.
- The player has the opportunity not to perform this task, but in tedy gets a ***penalty*** (it is assumed that he has to drink a "shot" of alcohol).
- Cell draw lots using 2 virtual dice

## How to install this example Golang project on Kubernetes

The easiest way to see how this works is to watch the series, but here's the short version.

1. clone this project
2. download godot4 - https://godotengine.org/
3. Run this project in godot

## Future plans (Work in progress)

- Main thing I want to do is re-write this game on C# due to 
- I want to implement the ability to create user's own tasks (currently prototype design is ready; see links) 
- Create multi- devices lobbies aka create "multiplayer"
- Create random tasks that appears at any moment and captures all participants
- Create some "special" game-roles, tasks and events
- Reimplement dice visual
- Create font behavior (adaptation) to differrent shapes and sizes. (Inspired by the font behavior in Paradox interactive's global stategy games)
  
This project is till ongoing.
